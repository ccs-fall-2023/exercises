# Working with JavaScript Data Types Exercises

The exercises below are designed to get you used to working with basic JavaScript data types. There are six exercises in the `index.js` file in the `./scripts` directory.

There are comments for each exercise explaining the type that should be returned. They'll get progressively more difficult with each exercise.

Your task is to open your browser `console` to view the output. Then open the `index.js` file in your code editor. You'll make changes to each function to output the desired output. **You don't need to change the functions themselves.** Make your changes inside of the curly brackets, `{}`.

Save your changes to the file, reload the browser, and view the output in the `console`.

## CHEAT SHEET

* "Declaring" a variable is done via the keywords `const`, `let`, and `var`.
* "Instantiating" a variable is assigning it a value.
* An array is in square brackets, `[]`.
* An object is in curly brackets, `{}`.
* A "key-value pair" follows the format: `key: value`.
* The word `return` is magic âœ¨ (we'll discuss this more later)
