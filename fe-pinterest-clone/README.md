# Pinterest(ish) Clone

Create a Pinterest "Clone" Using Flexbox and Responsive Web Design.

This can be done in CodeSanbox, CodePen, or a local folder. Your choice!

If you choose the local folder option, following this folder structure:

* Make a directory called `pinterest_clone`
* Change into that directory
* **INITIALIZE A GIT REPO!!!**
* Inside of `pinterest_clone` make two more folders:
  * Make a subdirectory called `styles`
  * If you're using _local_ images, make a subdirectory called `images`
* In the `pinterest_clone` folder create an `index.html`
* In the `pinterest_clone/styles` subfolder make a file called `style.css`
* You'll add any _local_ images to your `images` folder
* **COMMIT THESE FILES!!!**
  * `git status`
  * `git add` (you'll do this for every file/folder)
  * `git status`
  * `git commit -m "Initial Commit` <br/>(feel free to change the message text from "Initial Commit" to something more descriptive)

* Display 6 images total
  * [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) is helpful for placeholder images
  * However, feel free to download your own and reference from a local folder!
* By default, it shows all images in a single column
  * At 640px and up to 960px, it shows 2 images per row, for 3 rows
  * At 960px and up, it shows 3 images per row for 2 rows
