# Exercises

## Let's Go Shopping

- Fork and clone this repo: [DOM Shopping List](https://github.com/seanrreid/DOM-shopping-list)
- Follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/seanrreid/DOM-shopping-list/blob/main/README.md) file to make a dynamic shopping list.

**NOTE:** The patterns being used here are _very_ similar to the MadLibs exercises, and the in class exercises. The end result is different, but many of the pieces are the same. For example:

- `input` elements
- replacing `innerText`
- `querySelector` and/or `querySelectorAll`
- `addEventListener` to listen for a `click` event
- etc...
