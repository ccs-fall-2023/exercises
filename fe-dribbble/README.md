# Build a Site from a Mock Up

## Step 1 - Get Started

* Go to [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/signup/new) and register for an account (it's free!)
* Browse the [web design inspirations](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design)<br/>**OR** Search for a type of website, i.e. "Landing Page" or "Blog"
* Decide on a design to use as inspiration

## Step 2 - Folder Structure

* Make a directory called `dribbble_design`
* Change into that directory
* **INITIALIZE A GIT REPO!!!**
* Inside of `dribbble_design` make two more folders:
  * Make a subdirectory called `images`
  * Make a subdirectory called `styles`
* In the `dribbble_design` folder create an `index.html`
* In the `dribble_design/styles` subfolder make a file called `style.css`
* You'll add any images to your `images` folder
* **COMMIT THESE FILES!!!**
  * `git status`
  * `git add` (you'll do this for every file/folder)
  * `git status`
  * `git commit -m "Initial Commit` <br/>(feel free to change the message text from "Initial Commit" to something more descriptive)

## Step 3 - Build the Site

* Use the text from your Grimm's Fairy Tales exercise as content.
* Use the design you selected in Step 1 as your design format.
* Build a site that matches the design, using the content from the fairy tale.
