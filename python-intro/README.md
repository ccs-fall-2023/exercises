# Python Intro Exercises

## Learn Python Exercises

Start with these exercises from [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).  They can be done in the browser, but you should also save copies locally for review in the future. Put them in a directory called `learnpython`.

I **strongly recommend** reading everything before starting the exercises!

* [Learn Python: Hello World](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
* [Learn Python: Functions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions)
* [Learn Python: Conditions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions)
* [Learn Python: Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)

## Independant Exercises

Make a directory called `python_intro` to save all these files.

### Hello World!

* Write your own "Hello World" in Python

### String interpolation

Revenge of the "Mad Libs"

* Prompt the use to input a noun
* Prompt the use to input a verb
* Using String Interpolation, print a silly sentence with those words.

### String interpolation + Lists

Abbot and Costellor vs the Mad Lib List

* Define the necessary word types, i.e. "noun, verb, adjective," using a list.
* The words will be the `key`, the initial `value` for each `key` will be blank
* Using the list, prompt the user for input to update the `value` for each `key`
* Using String Interpolation, print a silly sentence with those words.
