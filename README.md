# Exercises

This repo contains all the exercises (and _some_ solutions, but hidden by design ðŸ˜‰) for the Fall 2023 cohort.

These exercises are intended as individual or small group projects to help reinforce technical concepts for students. Assignments may be given as in-class requirements, overnight work, or larger weekend projects.

The folders will use the following naming conventions:

* `fe-`: Frontend work. HTML/CSS with possible light JS/interactivity
* `js-`: JavaScript. Exercises focused on functionality or syntax practice.
* `react-`: React library practice. Small apps or components.
* `py-`: Python exercises. Backend, CLI, or data-oriented work.
* `flask-`: Flask framework exercises. May be apps or bits of functionality in given apps.
* `django-`: Django framework practice. Likely full apps/larger projects.
