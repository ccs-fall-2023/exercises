# Working with JavaScript Functions

The exercises below are designed to get you used to working with JavaScript functions. There are seven exercises in the `exercises.js` file in the `./scripts` directory.

There are comments for each exercise explaining the function to be written. Some wil resemble what we did in lecture. Others will require a bit of research and collaboration.

Your task is to open your browser `console` to view the output. Then open the `exercises.js` file in your code editor. You'll make changes to each function to output the desired output.

Save your changes to the file, reload the browser, and view the output in the `console`.
