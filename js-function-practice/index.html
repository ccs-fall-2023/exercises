                    Working with JavaScript Functions
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The exercises below are designed to get you used to working
                    with JavaScript functions. There are seven exercises in the
                    <code>exercises.js</code> file in the
                    <code>./scripts</code> directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are comments for each exercise explaining the function
                    to be written. Some wil resemble what we did in lecture.
                    Others will require a bit of research and collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your task is to open your browser <code>console</code> to
                    view the output. Then open the
                    <code>exercises.js</code> file in your code editor. You'll
                    make changes to each function to output the desired output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Save your changes to the file, reload the browser, and view
                    the output in the <code>console</code>.
