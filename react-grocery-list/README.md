# Let's Go Shopping - The React Version!@

You've done this before in HTML/CSS/JS, now it's time to try it in React!

## Dynamically Create a Shopping List

* User fills out the form
* User clicks the "Make My List" button
* Items from the form populate the list

### Hints

* You'll want to use controlled inputs!
* You'll want to `useState` to keep track of what the user adds to their list.
* You'll want to `map()` through the user's list of groceries and generate a list.
